                Elite Career Initiative was born from a simple observation: despite Ghana's growing economy and 
                excellent educational institutions, many talented young people struggled to transition from 
                university to meaningful employment. The disconnect between academic preparation and industry 
                expectations created barriers that limited potential and hindered economic growth.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Founded in 2025 by a team of passionate educators, industry professionals, and former students 
                who experienced these challenges firsthand, ECI set out to create comprehensive solutions. We 
                began with small workshops at the University of Ghana, focusing on CV writing and interview 
                preparation. The overwhelming response and success stories from our first participants confirmed 
                the critical need for our services.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Today, ECI has evolved into a comprehensive career development platform serving thousands of 
                young Ghanaians. Our programs have expanded to include mentorship matching, skills training, 
                industry networking events, and direct job placement services. We work closely with leading 
                companies across various sectors to ensure our training remains relevant and our participants
